# EbolaCoin
The Official Cryptocurrency of Ethics Bowl


## What is EbolaCoin?

EbolaCoin is a cryptocurrency I created to incentivice people to join the Washington State University Ethics-Bowl team. Members of the WSU Ethics-Bowl team are commonly refered to internally as E-Bolas, short for Ethics Bowlers. Those who attend meetings in person can recieve an EbolaCoin reward.

## Protocol

- EbolaCoin is an ERC20 compatible token that can be used as payment in any marketplace that accepts it. 
- As owner of the EbolaCoin smart contract, on ethics bowl meeting days I will set a private integer code in the contract that will be shared with the members present that day. 
- This code can be redeemed for an amount of EbolaCoin tokens. In addition to the code being set, I will specify that it can only be reedemed a total amount of times that matches the number of present members. At each meeting, I will reset the code and the amount of redeemabilities. 

- For those who wish to obtain EbolaCoin without coming to meetings in person, they must exchange ETH for EbolaCoin using the current exchange rate.
